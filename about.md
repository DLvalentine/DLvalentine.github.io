## Howdy: 

I'm David! 

You've somehow managed to find yourself in a terrifying and mysterious place. This is where my thoughts and feelings go to meet their ultimate demise. It is here that you will find conversations that were never had, opinions that were never publically opined, stories untold, and lessons never taught. 

That sounds really spooky. This is just a personal blog that's trying to wear ***many*** hats. 

To summarize myself in a sentence: I am a husband, brother, huge geek, and software enginner currently working at Amazon, dwelling in the beautiful state of Washington.

Some of the things I enjoy, and that you'll find written about herein: 
* Music
* Books
* Manga & Anime
* Video Games
* Programming & Computer Science

And maybe some other stuff. 

Links to contact me, and all that social media whosit-whatsit, live in bubbles found on the left side of your screen, or at the bottom for all my mobile folks. Failing that, you can [communicate your deep inner thoughts and wishes to me over the wire, here.](mailto:davidlewisvalentine@gmail.com)
