## Howdy 

I'm David! 

To summarize myself in a sentence: I am a husband, brother, huge geek, and software enginner currently working at Amazon, dwelling in the beautiful state of Washington.

You've somehow managed to find yourself in my blog/thing.

 ***~ s p o o k y ~***

Some of the things I enjoy, and that you'll find me writing about:
* Music
* Books
* Manga & Anime
* Video Games
* Programming & Computer Science
* Tabletop RPGs, like D&D (5e) and Pathfinder (1e)

And maybe some other stuff. I also like to take pictures of things and talking about or sharing it. It's fun for me.

Links to contact me, and all that social media whosit-whatsit, live in bubbles found on the left side of your screen, or at the bottom for all my mobile folks.

Failing that, you can [communicate your deep inner thoughts and wishes, professional or silly, to me over the wire, here.](mailto:davidlewisvalentine@gmail.com)

If you're interested in what I've done with my life so far, [here's my resume](/resume.pdf){:target="blank"}
