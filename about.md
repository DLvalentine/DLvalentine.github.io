## Howdy 

I originally spun this little site up to start a blog, probably mostly about software engineering or adjacent topics and stories of things I've done (or am doing) in my career. I quickly realized that those types of things are a dime a dozen, and any stories I have are probably
ones I'd prefer to tell in person over time. Voltaire probably felt the same when he stated that "the secret of being a bore is to tell everything". 

So I shifted, thought this could be a place where I could dump thoughts out of my brain, talk about whatever - but again - platforms exist for that (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and so on), and well... unless you *know* me (do I even know me?), you probably aren't interested. There's nothing new under the sun. 

But I keep coming back, keep trying to think of things to do with this space: a slice of internet few will stumble upon unless I make an active effort to show it off. So... I've been thinking of making this more of a journal. Not necessarily the type where you record your life to have some sort of sense of continuity later on, but one where I can record things that occupy me or interest me. Over the past couple of years since I spun this little site up, I have rediscovered the joy I get out of taking photos. So maybe I'll take one here or there and save it. Just for this journal. Maybe I'll jot down some thoughts to go with it. I also write software, enjoy a variety of entertainment, think, etc. In a way it still satisfies that "dump thoughts out of my brain" feeling I'm looking for, but in a way that (at least on the surface) feels less pointless.

So... well, I dunno, maybe some of the things that kick around in my head that I hesitate from posting on more "visible" platforms end up here. Not because they're wrong/bad or that I'm embarrassed by them, but because this is a space I control, one where I can just be.

Socials I care about are on the left (or bottom) nav, check 'em if you want, hit me up if you wanna chit chat.

See ya,
