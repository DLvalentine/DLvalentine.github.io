## Howdy 

I'm David. I like to take pictures of things - particularly birds.

I've always wanted to keep a photo journal, so this is my attempt at that.

I share the pictures I take primarily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dvalen_irl){:target="_blank"}. But if I have anything to say about a picture, or want to share *how* I shot a picture, I'll share it here in conjunction with (or in lieu of) the Instagram post.

Feel free to drop me a line, socials are on the navbar.

See ya,

\- D.
