## Howdy 

I'm David! 

You've somehow managed to find yourself in a terrifying and mysterious place: David's little Frankenstein's Monster of a blog. A spooky place where thoughts go to die.

To summarize myself in a sentence: I am a husband, brother, huge geek, and software enginner currently working at Amazon, dwelling in the beautiful state of Washington.

Some of the things I enjoy, and that you'll find written about:
* Music
* Books
* Manga & Anime
* Video Games
* Programming & Computer Science
* Tabletop RPGs, like D&D (5e) and Pathfinder (1e)
* Life, and anyone's musings about it.

And maybe some other stuff. I also like to take pictures of things and talk about them.

Links to contact me, and all that social media whosit-whatsit, live in bubbles found on the left side of your screen, or at the bottom for all my mobile folks. Failing that, you can [communicate your deep inner thoughts and wishes to me over the wire, here.](mailto:davidlewisvalentine@gmail.com)
