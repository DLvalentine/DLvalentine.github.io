Images *with exif data* that I want to share/style. This example may break if I've updated the util.js function without checking it here...

Markdown makes it easier to use HTML to make pretty documents. This line is an example of an annotation/abbreviation.

You can apply styles to blocks, it is really cool. Thanks, Kramdown!

## Things that aren't working...maybe I can make it work

Checkboxes:

[x]

[] 

Emojis, unless pasted. Not that big of a deal

Tables don't have styling. Might actually be useful, though. Example:

|header|
|------|
|cell content|
|more content|

## Etc.
