### Howdy

My name is David. It is known. 

  For a long time, I have felt an itch. That's right, the writing itch! Aside from being in an uncomfortable place to reach, I never felt like I had quite the right tools to scratch it.

*That changes today*. 

  While I will sacrifice discoverablility by not using platforms like Medium or Blogspot, I feel it is a fair price to pay if that means I can have freedom. I am not beholden to a platform that can hurt myself, or prevent others from being able to see the content I feel like producing. It also gives me the freedom to flex another muscle -- the ~technology~ muscle. I will be able to control more-or-less every aspect of this site to cater to the needs of myself and you - the audience.

  After reading that, you might be asking, *what content?*, and that's totally fair. I don't know yet. Leave that fancy marketing, ideating, and other fun stuff to me. Stephen King has a belief that resonates with me that will be prevalent in all my work here -- write for yourself first, and secondarily for your "Ideal Reader". My "Ideal Reader" is imaginary. Let's call him Deckard. This is all for him. Stay a while, and listen. Or don't. Your call.

  In the meantime, I'll be hacking away at this keyboard, tidying the site up and coming up with things to ramble about for you to read. By the time you read this, I'll probably have front-loaded the site with content so it doesn't look so drab and boring. Or there might not ever be anything here. I might give it up, like many little projects I've half completed or given up in search of *the one* to stick with. You'll just have to keep coming back to find out!


Go forth, and be good people,
- D
